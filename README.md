# **__What Problem Does The Application Solve?__**  
Live Big is an app that lets you track your daily habits and allows the user to create new habits that they would like to accomplish to enhance their daily lifestyle.

# **__What Is The App Doing And Why?__**
Live Big is keeping track of the users activity goals that they would like to keep track of throughout the week to better their good habits in their lives. Everyone at some point in their life wants to try and get on the right path to a healthier life, and we created Live Big to help them stay on the right path and help accomplish those goals. 

# **__How Is The App Used/Organized?__**
Live Big is organized through multiple pages. We have a page that allows the user to log-in and keep track of their progress with how they are doing at achieving their goals throughout the week.
Another page we have allows the user to input the activities that they are accomplishing throughout the week, and have that information stored into a table to track the progress.
The last page is where the user sees how many of their goals they have completed and how far they've come to completing all of their goals.
